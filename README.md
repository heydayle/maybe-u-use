# Maybe u_use

The project accumulates and shares the code that programmers use repeatedly in many different projects.

Currently, the project is in the early stages of development and I am learning about the code snippets that developers use most in my projects so that I can synthesize as much as possible for the first demo.

The project is apply Nuxt 2, Vuetify and Windicss for build.

You can come [here](https://u-use.vercel.app/) to experience and participate in my project if you like it.
